# Construction of Proxy Record Age Models (COPRA)

This package implements the heuristic framework proposed in [1] to
estimate the uncertainty in proxy record estimation from radiometrically
dated sedimentary archives. The method in [1] is essentially a numerical
conceptualisation of the analytical proxy uncertainties derived in [2]. 

The current implementation seeks to extend some of the key aspects:
[] Radiocarbon dating calibration (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
[x] Final proxy record models on a regularly spaced time axis

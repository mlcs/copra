copra -   COnstructing Proxy Records from Age-models (COPRA)

          This module implements the heuristic framework put forward in [1],
          allowing users to estimate an ensemble of age models and
          consequently an ensemble of proxy record models based on initial
          age v/s depth and proxy v/s depth measurements. In principle, the
          current implementation is, in some ways, an extension of the ideas
          described in [1] and these new developments will be soon
          communicated in an upcoming publication.
